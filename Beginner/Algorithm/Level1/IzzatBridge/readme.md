Title : Old bridge problem

Version : 1

## Introduction
---
There is an old, long rope bridge inside a dark cave. Groups of explorers are sent into the cave and each group needs to cross the bridge in order to continue exploring to other side of the cave. The groups are released one group at a time, and each group will be provided with one torchlight.

Since the bridge is old, only two persons are allowed to cross the bridge. Besides that, since the area is dark, each back and forth trip across the bridge requires torchlight guide.

## Description of project
---
Example:
[Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7yDmGnA8Hw0)
People in a group: A, B and C
Trip 1: A and B cross the bridge with torchlight, then A brings the torchlight back to starting location
Trip 2: A bring C across the bridge with torchlight
Trip finishes since all people have successfully cross the bridge.

##### Instruction
Example:
People in a group: A, B and C
Trip 1: A and B cross the bridge with torchlight, then A brings the torchlight back to starting location
Trip 2: A bring C across the bridge with torchlight
Trip finishes since all people have successfully cross the bridge

Each person will take 'x' amount time to cross the bridge. Please write an algorithm that takes each person's name and walking time, and output the person trip turn and total trip time with the minimum total trip time as possible.

Example:
> Input:
> A	1min
> B	2min
> C	5min
> D	10min

Output:
> The people's turn is:
> 1. ??
> 2. ??
> 3. ??
> 4. ??
Total trip time = 17 mins

## Requirement
---
- Please may provide your answer in algorithm format (step by step) or in a executable program in any language.
